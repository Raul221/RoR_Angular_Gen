## Usage

The version of generator uses SASS Bootstrap as its main theme. If you want to use Compass framework, make sure that you
view their docs to know what to include [Compass](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass)

To run the serve, and start building your application
```
$ grunt serve
```
It will automatically open the webpage on your localhost:9000, or you will have to do it manuallly

To run test
```
$ grunt karma:unit:start
```

To run e2e test. This requires selenium browser and chromedriver. Make sure you view [angular/protractor] (https://github.com/angular/protractor)
```
$ grunt shell:protractor
```

To build files for production
```
$ grunt build
```

This also supports for subgenerator for controller, filter, service, and directive as well. Make sure you link them in your
main module

```
$ yo angular-with-require:controller "name" #replace the name with your module name
$ yo angular-with-require:service "name" #replace the name with your module name
$ yo angular-with-require:directive "name" #replace the name with your module name
$ yo angular-with-require:filter "name" #replace the name with your module name
```
